#%RAML 1.0

# Objective: This test covers the case that additionProperties is an object. It
#            is very common syntax in OAS and JSON, but the only allowed value
#            in RAML is a boolean.
# Expected result: Test fails with an error that contains a message that the
#                  allowed value of 'additionalProperties' is a boolean. Line
#                  numbers should indicate where it happens.

# tags: type, object, additional property
