# Objective: This test covers the case that 'items' is something else than either
#            a reference to an existing type or an inline type declaration.
# Expected result: Test fails with an error that contains a message that the
#                  allowed value of 'items' is either a reference to an existing
#                  type or an inline type declaration. Line numbers should
#                  indicate where it happens.

# tags: type, array, facet
