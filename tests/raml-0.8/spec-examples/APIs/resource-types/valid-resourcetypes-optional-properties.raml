# A resource type or trait definition MAY append a question mark ("?") suffix to the name of any non-scalar
# property that should not be applied if it doesn't already exist in the resource or method at the
# corresponding level. This optional structure key indicates that the value of the property should be applied if
# the property name itself (without the question mark) is already defined (whether explicitly or implicitly) at
# the corresponding level in that resource or method.
# The following example shows an optional post? property that defines a body parameter called
# createAuthority. If the inheriting resource defines a post method, it will include the createAuthority
# property in its body. Likewise, if the inheriting resource defines a delete method, it will include the
# deleteAuthority property in its body.
