# If the header name contains the placeholder token {*}, processing applications MUST allow requests to send any
# number of headers that conform to the format specified, with {*} replaced by 0 or more valid header characters, and
# offer a way for implementations to add an arbitrary number of such headers. This is particularly useful for APIs
# that allow HTTP headers that conform to custom naming conventions to send arbitrary, custom data.

# In the following example, the header x-metadata-{*} is used to send metadata that will be saved with the job.
